<h1 id="speedtracker-performance-regression-testing">Speedtracker: Performance Regression Testing</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-speedtracker">What is Speedtracker?</h2>
<p>Speedtracker is a module within IFDIFF to test for performance regressions. It tracks versions of the project’s development (“snapshots”) as well as performance benchmarks. When invoked, it successively loads each snapshot, runs the benchmarks on that snapshot, and collects and displays the results. These versions are simply Git commits stored under a name. It is also possible to call Speedtracker directly using Git commit SHAs, without creating a snapshot beforehand.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-requirements">Goals and Requirements</h2>
<p>Speedtracker is intended to track long-term deteriorations in the performance due to inefficiencies accidentally introduced into the code. This and the small and fluctuating development team mean that we cannot rely on a pristine, consistent testing environment: Two benchmarking runs six months apart may produce different results solely because the developer’s computer got slowed down by software bloat. Therefore, every benchmarking run must compare all snapshots on the local machine, right at the moment it is performed.</p>
<p>Another requirement is to avoid the use of extra software and infrastructure because there is nobody to manage it. Speedtracker should be callable from within MATLAB &reg; and use only MATLAB, OS commands, and Git.</p>
<p>Speedtracker aims to be compatible with Windows and Linux and with MATLAB versions from R2017a onward.</p>
<p>Users are assumed to be decently familiar with MATLAB, IFDIFF, and Git.</p>
<h2 id="use-instructions">Use Instructions</h2>
<p>Refer to <code>instructions.odt</code> for a tutorial and more instructions. These instructions double as a loose technical specification of the module’s functionality, so you should also be familiar with them before attempting to change Speedtracker. The code structure is documented in <code>structure.odt</code>. Read this as well before you make any changes; the structure and conventions are not always self-explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="development-process">Development Process</h2>
<p>This is hopefully going to remain a small module, allowing us to stick to the following simple process. When adding or modifying functionality, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add the desired functionality to <code>instructions.odt</code>. The “loose technical specification” mentioned above consists of the sections “System Functions Reference” and “Configuration Reference”. Each of the system functions comprises:
<ol type="1">
<li>Name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Inputs/how to perform</li>
<li>Preconditions</li>
<li>Output</li>
<li>Postconditions</li>
<li>Exceptions (ways it could go wrong and what it does in that case)</li>
<li>(optional) Notes</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Implement the functionality in code. Consult <code>structure.odt</code> if you do not know where to start, it gives a rundown of the basic program flow and structure. Also please update this file if you make any changes or extensions to major architectural components.</li>
<li>Test the functionality. For now, the test procedure is to manually try out</li>
<li>every correct way of using the SF</li>
<li>every exception described in the SF</li>
<li>every set of inputs that does not match what the “Inputs/how to perform” section stipulates. e.g., if it says the first argument to a command should be a nonempty string, try out what happens when you pass in the empty string and what happens when you pass in a non-string value like a number.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>If you find something that does not work, consult the above section “Development Process” and <code>structure.odt</code> for help making sense of the code. Some additional tips:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Since Speedtracker copies its own code to a temp directory, you cannot set breakpoints in source files. There is a workaround, however: The main script <code>speedtracker.m</code> runs from the home directory. Put a breakpoint at the statement <code>command.execute(...)</code>, then use the “Step in” button to step into the <code>execute</code> method. MATLAB will open the temp copy of the class that the method belongs to, and you can set breakpoints there that will work.</li>
<li>If you want to test internal methods or intermediate states, it is tedious to recreate the temp directory and other infrastructure manually. Instead, there is a <code>UserCommand</code> subclass <code>speedtracker/commands/ScrewAroundCommand</code> that is disabled by default and that you can put any code in. To enable it, locate the line in <code>speedtracker.m</code> where the commands (<code>RunBenchmarksCommand</code>, <code>CreateSnapshotCommand</code>, etc.) are instantiated and add a <code>ScrewAroundCommand()</code> to the array, then you can run it with <code>speedtracker screw-around</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="programming-guidelines">Programming Guidelines</h2>
<p>For now, our guidelines are small enough to stay here instead of in a separate file. Read <code>structure.odt</code> for more detail on how these goals are implemented; this section is only about general guidelines.</p>
<p>The most important non-functional requirement is robustness. Git has many features and makes it easy to create confusing repository states that a developer who merely uses it and is not a Git expert may have a hard time figuring out how to get back from. Since we are checking out past versions of the same repo, we must take care not to check out a version where Speedtracker does not exist and cannot restore the program state.<br />
For these reasons, check the results of every OS/Git call and think of how to ensure that a failed operation can restore the state before it happened. Different exceptions should have well-defined error identifiers which are defined as public class constants.</p>
<p>Error handling in general: syntax errors/faulty arguments print out a usage message and one line describing which argument is wrong. Semantic errors, e.g. creating a snapshot with a name already taken, print out a one-liner explaining what happened. Truly unexpected exceptions are logged fully, with stack trace. Setting the configuration option <code>HideErrors</code> to false will cause all errors to be logged in detail.</p>
<p>All code besides <code>speedtracker.m</code>, benchmark and config files must go in the <code>speedtracker</code> folder, because copying it to a temp location is how the module prevents checking-out of old snapshots from breaking itself.</p>
<p>The Speedtracker code uses classes and interfaces for top-level organization, but is largely procedural, not object-oriented. For example, the class SnapshotLoader, through which the main program manages snapshots, is an abstract class.</p>
<p>Data Types:<br />
Use char arrays and cellstrings, not strings. Vectors are row vectors wherever row or column would both work.</p>
<p>Expected Userbase:<br />
Users are developers of IFDIFF and can thus be expected to have a high degree of expertise in MATLAB. As developers, they will not require Speedtracker to be fully user-friendly, but it should be easy to use and understand nonetheless, since it is a development tool and not a core part of IFDIFF’s code.</p>
<p>Expect users to have everyday knowledge of Git: add, commit, push, pull, but no more.</p>
<p>Git Usage Internally:<br />
Some Git commands use advanced terminal features like coloring that are implemented with ANSI escape sequences and similar. On Linux, output of Git commands may contain these escape sequences, making handling them very difficult. For this reason, avoid using commands like <code>git tag</code>, <code>git show</code>, and <code>git diff</code>. The commands listed under “Plumbing Commands” in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/">Git docs</a> are intended for scripting and do not use escape sequences. Some commands, like <code>git add</code>, are okay and are used in Speedtracker.</p>
