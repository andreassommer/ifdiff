classdef Benchmark
    %BENCHMARK A benchmark for identifying regressions
    % Consists of:
    % an RHS (as the name of the .m file containing the function)
    % an ODE solver
    % a time horizon
    % initial values, in a column vector matching the dimensions of the RHS
    % a parameter, matching the dimensions that the RHS expects
    % ODE solver options (from odeset)

    properties (GetAccess=public, SetAccess=private)
        % string (you can pass char into the constructor, though)
        id;
        % string (you can pass char into the constructor, though)
        rhs;
        % string (you can pass char into the constructor, though)
        solver;
        % 1x2 double
        tSpan;
        % d x 1 double, d matching the input/output dimension prescribed by rhs
        initVals;
        % double, dimension matching rhs
        p;
        % struct as generated by odeset(...)
        odeOptions;
